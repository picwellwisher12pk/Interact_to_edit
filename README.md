Interact_to_edit (How it came into being)
================
Initially , my challange was to have some interactive method to edit the Table cell in an Web Application, without opening 
without opening any dialogue or popup, and that is very easy and intuitively in use. So I came up with an idea of "Double 
clicking" over the desired Table cell or HTML node to edit it. Then I started looking into and developing this small 
script. In beginning I thought of naming this script "Double Click to Edit", then I thought why not make it flexible so 
that I can apply it on any other desired event too. So I named it "Interact to Edit".
